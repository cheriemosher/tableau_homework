The first dashboard I made, titled citi_bike_trip_duration_per_year, used data that was summarized using pandas scripts.  I averaged the data based on starting station for all months from 2017, 2018, and 2019.  I found that trip duration was longest during the summer months and shortest during the winter months.  The month with the longest average trip duration was June of 2018.  Also, the graph for that year was a little less round than those of the other two years.  I decided to look more closely at June of 2018 first.

I mapped out the average trip durations per starting station for June, 2018.  Three stations showed huge averages compared to the rest, and the values were far greater than one would expect for a user renting a Citi Bike.  I graphed all of the trip durations for three stations that had the longest average durations.  There are clear outliers for all three stations.  It is not obvious why these stations have such long durations.  It may be a concern for Citi Bike, if this is a malfunction in these stations.

I created a dashboard, titled citi_bike_trip_duration_per_year, comparing that average trip duration per starting station and the median trip duration per station.  Using the median duration reduced the impact of the long durations for the previously mentioned stations.  This map showed that there are longer trip durations towards the edges of the city limits.  This seems to make sense as individuals from these locations may be using the bikes to get to more central locations, requiring a longer trip.  As we will see in the story, there is a balance between the duration of trips and the total number of trips per station.  Stations that are towards the edges of city may have fewer uses, but the trips are longer.

The tableau story, titled citi_bike_june_2019, reflects on the data from the month (June) with the longest trip durations for 2019.  The first map shows the average trip durations for starting stations.  Yet again, there were long durations for similar geographic regions as we saw in 2018.  We should do more exploration to better understand what is happening at these stations, and whether it is beneficial for Citi Bike.

Next, I broke down the total uses from June, 2019, by gender.  Male use was significantly greater than female use.  The next map shows the male/female ratio by zip code from 2018.  It appears that there is an untapped market of female use for Citi Bike.  I suggest more research into why female use is less than male use, even in areas where the ratio of males-to-females is nearly equal.

I also graphed the total use of Citi Bike against age.  I removed the age of '50' as there was an unexplained spike in that year (possible do to reporting issues).  I included a map of total use by starting station against median age range per zip code.
